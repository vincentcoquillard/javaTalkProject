# Software-Project
We have to implement, using software development method, a chatroom a bit like whatsapp. 
The group is composed by TSHIBUNZI Cippora Sagesse, COQUILLARD Vincent, TETU Raphaël, SIBONI Elie and CAZENAVE Vincent.

Each of us had specific tasks for the project.

TSHIBUNZI Cippora Sagesse: Role: UML implementation, Client SERVER  Tasks:

COQUILLARD Vincent: Role: Communication between database and software. Tasks: .

TETU Raphaël: Role: Design of the software. Tasks:

SIBONI Elie:Role: Tasks:

CAZENAVE Vincent: Role: Interface implementation. Tasks:


We chose to use the AGILE model using the scrum method for many reasons:
  
    -We will focus more on the code than the design 
    -We will need an iterative approach whith short sprints (about a week) in order to implement the project faster
    -We will need to deliver quickly a working version of the software in order to see what can be improved and problems
    that can be solved.
    -We will need to plan every tasks and therefore the different roles for every member of the group. 
    
    
In order to create the list of requirements, we adopted two different point of view. First, we acted as we were users and we said
which functionalities we needed, the must ones and the other that are a plus to the software. Then, we adopted the point of view
of developers and found non-functional requirements that were essentials to a software like that.
